30-70 RSI Strategy
This strategy is based on the assumption that:

RSI below 30 → The asset is oversold → Potential buy opportunity.
RSI above 70 → The asset is overbought → Potential sell opportunity.
Trading Signals
Buy Signal (RSI < 30)

When RSI drops below 30, it indicates that the asset is oversold and may be undervalued.
A trader might enter a long position when RSI crosses back above 30 (confirmation of trend reversal).
Sell Signal (RSI > 70)

When RSI rises above 70, it suggests the asset is overbought and could be due for a price correction.
A trader might enter a short position when RSI crosses back below 70.
